# Snake Game

A classic Snake game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to make the snake as long as possible without running into the walls or its own tail.

## How to Play

- The game is played on a grid and the snake moves in one direction at a time.
- The player controls which direction the snake goes by using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
- As the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and the player must navigate the increasingly complex maze formed by the snake's body.
- If the snake runs into the walls or its own tail, the game is over and the player must start again.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer
- Timeless gameplay that can be enjoyed by people of all ages
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a fast and responsive experience
